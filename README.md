# Bandcampy
Python3 script that: 
1) downloads any series of albums from bandcamp (links of bandcamp album pages seperated by commas)
2) automatically adds mp3 metadata for the album and the songs
3) automatically sorts everything into a folder in the directory of your choosing


To run you will need to install all imports using pip
